These searches utilize the power of API calls to Spotify, Bands in Town, and OMDB.

To perform a search, you will need to clone this git repository and then create an .env file that contains your own spotify API login credentials. You will also need to do an "npm install" to install any of the required npm libraries. These are noted in the package.json file. It is also assumed that you have node.
